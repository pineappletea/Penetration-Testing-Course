# Week 2

On last weeks lecture we had visitor Riku Juurikko giving a presentation on Social Engineering.

## z) Read the material, take notes

### Riku's Slides (not public)

- Hacker Mindset: theres limitless ways to achieve an objective, trying to figure out unusual ways.
- recommended social engineering books by Christopher hadgany
- mentioned a new trend of hackers selling access credentials online, thought of "not being responsible" when not actually using the credentials for nefarious purposes themselves
- Social engineering is: 
    - influencing/manipulating.
    - most common way to gain access
    - low risk - high reward
- Modern organizations often have very advanced technological defenses, employees end up being the weak point
- Social engineering steps: Recon(passive intelligence gathering), Scan (active), Exploit, Pivot, Covering Tracks
- Overwhelmingly most common motivation of the attacker is money
- Typical information gathered about target(for attack vectors):
    - organization structure
    - partners
    - service providers
    - job applications
    - interesting domains
    - open services
- Intelligence Collection Plan
- intel tools: osintframework, bellingcat, fonecta.fi, finder.fi
- gathering intel isnt just gathering data, also processing it

Principles of persuasion: 
    - reciprocity (be the first to give, the other feels obligated to return the favor)
    - scarcity (limited supply creates sense of urgency)
    - authority
    - commitment and consistency (once people are committed to something, it becomes harder for them to stop. Start small. Sunk cost fallacy)
    - liking (compliments, clean physical appearance, similarity, co-operation)
    - social proof(others have liked this -> so should you)
    - unity (sense of belonging to a tribe)

Package(the exploit)
- pretexting (For walking in: creating the story of who you are, what you are doing there. Do your homework, look the part)
- phising (making target give information or download a file they shouldnt)
- smshing (spoofing the SMS-sender information to look like fe. microsoft)
- vishing (phonecalls, for example fake it support)

What to do about the social engineering exploits, defense:
- dont get too cynical, people are mostly nice, genuine
- to recognize manipulation: if you feel the need to say "yes" to something above normal - stop, evaluate
- if uncertain, ask for help from others

## a) Find a case of an intrusion into a company using social engineering. Analyze the case based on Riku's teachings. Were there alternative or better available avenues of attack? How couldve the attacks been prevented, detected or their impacts limited?


## b) Riku's citations. Present 3-5 key lessons from one of Riku's sources.

## b2) Webgoat assigments.
